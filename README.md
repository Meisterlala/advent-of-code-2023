# Advent of Code 2023

### What is Advent of Code?
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

### What is this repository?
This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 puzzles. I will be using Rust to solve the puzzles.

### How to run the code?
To run the code, you need to have Rust installed. You can install Rust from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Once you have Rust installed, you execute all the days using the following command:

```bash
cd runner
cargo run --release
```

You can excecute only a single day using the following command:

```bash 
cd day01a
cargo run --release
```
