## What is Advent of Code? ðŸŽ„

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. Each day there will be a new problem that is split into 2 parts. The second parts is a more difficult variation of the first part. This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 puzzles


### Some of the techniques used in the solutions

- [Parser combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator) to read the puzzle inputs
- Range math to track multiple mappings between values during [Day 05](src/day_05.rs)
- [Quadratic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_programming) during [Day 06](src/day_06.rs) to find the minimum and maximum of a function. Which avoids having to use a brute force approach and instead solving it in constant time.
- [Cycle detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection) during [Day 08](src/day_07.rs) to count the length of a sub cycle and then use that to calculate the length of the full cycle with the [least common multiple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple).
- [Pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle) during [Day 09](src/day_09.rs) to calculate the binomial coefficients and predict the next value in a sequence.
- [Point in Polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_in_polygon) during [Day 10](src/day_10.rs) to determine how many free spaces are enclosed by a line.
- [Dynamic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming) during [Day 12](src/day_12.rs) to solve the recursiveness of the problem in a reasonable time.
- [A* search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) during [Day 17](src/day_17.rs) to find the shortest path between two points, while following certain restrictions.
- [Shoelace formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula) during [Day 18](src/day_18.rs) to calculate the area of a polygon. Here is a rendering of the [Day 18 Part 1](.github/day_18_a.svg) and [Day 18 Part 2](.github/day_18_b.svg) polygon.

## Try it out

### How to run the code?

To run the code, you'll first need to obtain the puzzle inputs from the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) website and place them in the [input folder](inputs). Or save your session cookie in the environment variable `AOC_SESSION`.

You'll also need to have Rust installed on your system. If you haven't installed it yet, you can download it from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Once you have Rust installed and the inputs in place, you can run all the puzzles using the following command:

```sh
# Run all the days
cargo run --release
# Run a specific days
cargo run --release -- day01
```


### How to benchmark the code?

You can benchmark the performance of the code using the following commands:

```sh
# Benchmark all the days
cargo bench
# Benchmark a specific days
cargo bench -- day01
```
