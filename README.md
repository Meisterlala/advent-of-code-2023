# Advent of Code 2023 [![Build and test](https://github.com/Meisterlala/advent-of-code-2023/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Meisterlala/advent-of-code-2023/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

### What is this repository?

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 puzzles. I will be using Rust to solve the puzzles.

### How to run the code?

To run the code, you need to have Rust installed. You can install Rust from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Once you have Rust installed, you execute all the days using the following command:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

or you can execute a specific day using the following command:

```bash
cargo run --release -- day01
```

### How to benchmark the code?

The performance of the code can be benchmarked using the following command:

```bash
cargo bench
cargo bench -- day01
```
