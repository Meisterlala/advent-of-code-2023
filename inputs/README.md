Input not included in the repository. You can download it manually on the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/2023) after logging in.

Or you can set the session cookie in the environment variable `AOC_SESSION` or in the `.env` file. Running the program with `cargo run` will then download the input automatically.

Input is expected to be files named `day01`, `day02`, etc. in the `inputs` directory.
